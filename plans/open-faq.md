## Friday Night Lights Structure
Athletes will reserve their heat time in push press. The time you choose is the time your workout
will start. When athletes show up they will be briefed and run through a warm up before their go
time. Heat times and duration will be dependent on each workout. Heats will run from 4:30pm to
about 6:30-7pm. Each athlete will have a judge/counter!
